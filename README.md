# Employee Database
## Develop database using SQL

### The steps taken to create an Employee Database
1.) Inspected the data which is provided in 6 separate CSV files.  Using this information sketched out an Entity Relationship Diagram (EDR) of the tables needed and their relationships to each other.

2.) Reviewed and clean data.  For primary key checked to see if employee id is unique.  If not create a composite key as primary key.

3.) Created PostgreSQL Database using pgAdmin and built schema.

4.) Imported each CSV file into it's respective SQL table in the database.

5.) Wrote an SQL query script using JOIN with GROUP BY and ORDER BY and more to test the database and schema I created.
